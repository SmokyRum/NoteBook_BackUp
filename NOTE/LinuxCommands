Formatting a drive :

1) sudo fdisk -l

List all partitions on all available disks.

2) sudo wipefs --all /dev/sdb

3) sudo wipefs --all /dev/sdb

4) For FAT32 --

sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1

5) For NTFS --

sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdb1

6) For exFAT --

sudo mkfs.exfat /dev/sdb1

7) Verify USB Drive Formatting

sudo fsck /dev/sdb1

8) Adding a recurring process in linux using contrab --

crontab -e

Add the following line to schedule a job that cleans the /tmp directory every minute:

* * * * * find /tmp -mindepth 1 -delete

The five asterisks represent the schedule for the cron job, indicating minutes, hours, days of the month, months, and days of the week, respectively.
(*) in each position means "every." So, * * * * * means every minute.

find /tmp: This is the find command that searches for files and directories in the /tmp directory.

-mindepth 1: This option ensures that find does not include the top-level directory itself in the search. It starts the search from the second level and deeper.

-delete: This option of the find command deletes the files and directories that match the specified criteria. In this case, it deletes all files and directories within.

9) Monitor SSD Health --

sudo apt install smartmontools

sudo smartctl -a /dev/nvme0

10) Create a shortcut for Linux commands --

sudo nano ~/.bashrc

add --

alias mycommand='actual long command' //Make sure not add space between, it does not support.

source ~/.bashrc

11) Get hardware information --

sudo dmidecode

lshw

lscpu
